# Overlay App Rig

The [Overlay App Rig](https://github.com/muxy/overlay-app-rig) contains a pared down version of
the Overlay extension on Twitch. It runs a simulated extension environment allowing you to load
any apps written for the overlay from your computer and see the full extension experience.

It simulates the viewer UI displayed over a channel video as well as the broadcaster live and
config pages. It safely sandboxes development from any production data or network errors that
may occur, and lets you play around with Muxy's backend offerings.

The project is open source on GitHub and has a very thorough
[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/muxy/overlay-app-rig/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md)
there.

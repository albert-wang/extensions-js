# Muxy Extensions JS Library

The Muxy Extensions JS library provides easy access to Muxy's powerful extension
backend architecture.

Twitch extensions give developers an amazing opportunity to put interactive elements in front of
viewers in real-time, but building a backend that can handle millions of requests an hour is not
easy.

Muxy's extension backend has been built to withstand Twitch's viewer load and provide convenient
functionality that all extensions could need. It's easy to get started and costs nothing
to experiment.

See the complete dev site at [dev.muxy.io](https://dev.muxy.io) for information about Muxy and
our extensions platform.

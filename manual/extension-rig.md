# Panel Extension Rig

The [Panel Extension Rig](https://github.com/muxy/extensions-rig) simulates the Twitch environment
that extension run in. Combined with the Muxy SDK it allows extensions to safely be sandboxed away
from production data and any hiccups that can happen on Twitch's site. When running in the rig the
Muxy SDK also provides a pubsub system that works exactly like the production one on Twitch.

The project is open source on GitHub and has a convenient
[Getting Started Guide](https://github.com/muxy/extensions-rig/blob/master/docs/GettingStarted.md)
there.

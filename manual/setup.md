# Creating an Extension

Before you can use the Muxy Extension SDK you will have to create a new extension on
[https://dev.twitch.tv](https://dev.twitch.tv).

## Extension Secrets

The important fields you will need to use with Muxy are the **Client ID** from the __Overview__
section and the **Secret** from the __Settings__ section of Twitch.

## Submit to Muxy

Once you have those values, go to
[Muxy's Extension Developer Page](https://u.muxy.io/dashboard/developers), and add them to your
extensions list. This will associate the Twitch Extension with your account and allow the
developer rigs to work.

**NOTE**: If you ever change the secrets on Twitch, you will need to resubmit them to Muxy for
your extension to continue working.
